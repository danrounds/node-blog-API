# RESTful Blog API Demo

Really basic demonstration of CRUD functionality (with ephermial data) for blog posts.

With a data store and a front end, this would make a really rudamentary blog.

Just an exercise in getting used to Express.js routing and the REST paradigm.

Data model is [Thinkful's](http://www.thinkful.com).
